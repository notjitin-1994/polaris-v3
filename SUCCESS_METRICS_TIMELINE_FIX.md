# Success Metrics Timeline Line Fix

## Issue
The animated gradient timeline indicator line at the bottom of each success metrics card was not displaying properly. The line appeared broken or wasn't spanning the full width of the card as intended.

## Root Cause
The animated border element was positioned inside the content div (`<div className="relative z-10">`), which meant it was absolutely positioned relative to the content container rather than the card itself. This caused incorrect positioning and prevented the line from spanning the full width of the card.

## Solution
Moved the animated bottom border element outside of the content div so it's positioned absolutely relative to the card container, allowing it to properly span the full width at the bottom of each card.

## Changes Made

### File: `frontend/components/blueprint/infographics/SuccessMetricsInfographic.tsx`

#### Before (Incorrect Structure):
```tsx
<motion.div className="glass-strong relative overflow-hidden rounded-xl p-6">
  <div className="from-primary/5 to-secondary/5 absolute inset-0 bg-gradient-to-br opacity-50" />
  
  <div className="relative z-10">
    {/* Content */}
    
    {/* Animated bottom border - INSIDE content div */}
    <motion.div className="from-primary to-secondary absolute right-0 bottom-0 left-0 h-1 bg-gradient-to-r" />
  </div>
</motion.div>
```

#### After (Correct Structure):
```tsx
<motion.div className="glass-strong relative overflow-hidden rounded-xl p-6">
  <div className="from-primary/5 to-secondary/5 absolute inset-0 bg-gradient-to-br opacity-50" />
  
  <div className="relative z-10">
    {/* Content */}
  </div>
  
  {/* Animated bottom border - OUTSIDE content div, positioned relative to card */}
  <motion.div className="from-primary to-secondary absolute right-0 bottom-0 left-0 z-20 h-1 bg-gradient-to-r" />
</motion.div>
```

### Key Changes:
1. **Moved the animated border** from inside the content div to be a direct child of the card container (line 87-93)
2. **Added z-index of 20** to ensure the border displays above the background gradient (z-index: 20 > content z-index: 10)
3. **Updated comment** to clarify the positioning fix

## Technical Details

### Positioning Hierarchy:
- **Card container**: `relative` positioning (establishes positioning context)
- **Background gradient**: `absolute inset-0` (covers entire card)
- **Content div**: `relative z-10` (positioned above background)
- **Timeline border**: `absolute right-0 bottom-0 left-0 z-20` (spans full width at bottom, above everything)

### Animation:
The border animates from left to right using:
- `initial={{ scaleX: 0 }}` - starts at 0 width
- `animate={{ scaleX: 1 }}` - expands to full width
- `transformOrigin: 'left'` - expands from the left edge
- Staggered delays based on card index for sequential appearance

## Visual Result

### Before Fix:
- Timeline indicator line was missing or appeared broken
- Line didn't span the full width of the card
- Inconsistent visual appearance across cards

### After Fix:
- ✅ Timeline indicator line spans full width of each card
- ✅ Smooth gradient animation from primary to secondary color
- ✅ Proper z-index layering ensures visibility
- ✅ Consistent appearance across all metric cards

## Testing

- [x] No linting errors introduced
- [x] Timeline border displays at bottom of each card
- [x] Border spans full width (left edge to right edge)
- [x] Animation plays smoothly on card load
- [x] Proper layering with background gradient and content
- [x] Works across all three metric cards in the grid
