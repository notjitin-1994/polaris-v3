```

### Characteristics:

- **Tone:** Professional and aspirational

---

## Files Modified

### 1. Blueprint Page (`frontend/app/blueprint/[id]/page.tsx`)
- Updated default title
- Updated rename dialog placeholder
- Increased character capacity awareness

### 2. Dashboard Page (`frontend/app/page.tsx`)
- Updated rename dialog placeholder for consistency

### 3. Database Migration (`supabase/migrations/20250930_update_blueprint_titles.sql`)
- SQL script to update existing blueprints
- Updates NULL, empty, and generic titles
- Optional: Update all non-conforming titles

---

## Database Migration

### Migration Script Created:
```sql
-- Update blueprints with NULL or empty titles
UPDATE blueprint_generator
SET title = 'Starmap for Professional Development and Career Growth Path'
WHERE title IS NULL OR title = '';

-- Update old generic titles
UPDATE blueprint_generator
SET title = 'Starmap for Professional Development and Career Growth Path'
WHERE title IN (
  'Generated Blueprint',
  'Starmap for Professional Development',
  'Blueprint'
);
```

### How to Apply Migration:

#### Option 1: Via Supabase Dashboard
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Copy contents of migration file
4. Execute the SQL

#### Option 2: Via Supabase CLI
```bash
# From project root
cd supabase
supabase db push
```

#### Option 3: Via psql
```bash
psql <your-database-connection-string> -f migrations/20250930_update_blueprint_titles.sql
```

## Title Examples

### New Standard Title:
```
‚úÖ Starmap for Professional Development and Career Growth Path
```

### Previous Patterns (Being Updated):
```
‚ùå Generated Blueprint
‚ùå Starmap for Professional Development
‚ùå Blueprint
‚ùå Starmap for [Org/Team Name]
```

### Alternative Variations (If Customizing):
While the standard is comprehensive, users can customize to:
```
Starmap for Engineering Leadership Development
Starmap for Sales Team Professional Growth
Starmap for Product Management Career Path
Starmap for Technical Skills and Career Advancement
```

---

## Character Limit Considerations

### Current Settings:
- **Max Length:** 80 characters
- **Standard Title:** 64 characters
- **Remaining:** 16 characters buffer

### Why 64 Characters Works:
1. Fits comfortably within 80-char limit
2. Displays fully on all devices (14px font)
3. Descriptive without being verbose
4. Professional and complete

### Title Display:
```
Desktop (14px): "Starmap for Professional Development and Career Growth Path"
Mobile (12px):  "Starmap for Professional Development and Career Growth Path"
              ‚úÖ Full title visible on both!
```

## User Guidance
