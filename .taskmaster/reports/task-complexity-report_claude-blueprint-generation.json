			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate Claude Sonnet 4 API as Primary Generation Model",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the integration into: (1) API client setup and authentication, (2) prompt formatting and validation, (3) token/timeout controls, (4) exponential backoff and retry logic, (5) output validation (strict JSON), (6) error handling and logging, (7) unit test coverage for all scenarios.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves secure API integration, strict parameter enforcement, robust error handling, and output validation, each of which introduces branching logic and multiple failure modes. Industry best practices require separation of concerns, comprehensive testing, and security, justifying a moderate-high complexity and detailed subtasking."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Claude Opus 4 Fallback Logic",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: (1) failure detection and classification, (2) Opus 4 API invocation, (3) prompt reuse and adaptation, (4) fallback event logging and metrics, (5) security for API keys and endpoints, (6) unit tests for all fallback scenarios.",
			"reasoning": "The fallback logic requires precise error detection, seamless switching, and enhanced observability. While it builds on existing integration patterns, the need for robust logging and security increases complexity, but the scope is narrower than the primary integration."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate Ollama Emergency Fallback",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose into: (1) failure cascade detection, (2) Ollama client integration, (3) prompt adaptation logic, (4) timeout and retry controls, (5) error handling and logging, (6) environment configuration for local endpoint, (7) integration tests simulating all fallback paths.",
			"reasoning": "This task introduces a third model with a different prompt structure and local deployment, requiring careful adaptation, robust error handling, and integration testing. The complexity is elevated by the need to ensure reliability in rare but critical failure scenarios."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Create Claude API Proxy Endpoint",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into: (1) Next.js API route scaffolding, (2) request validation and authentication, (3) secure server-side Claude API call, (4) error and usage tracking, (5) strict JSON response formatting, (6) unit/integration tests for all cases.",
			"reasoning": "Proxy endpoints must enforce security, input validation, and error handling, while abstracting sensitive operations from the client. The complexity is moderate due to the need for secure design and comprehensive testing."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Real-Time Generation Status Endpoint",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into: (1) endpoint implementation, (2) DB status update logic, (3) polling and progress calculation, (4) future-proofing for SSE/WebSockets, (5) tests for status transitions and polling.",
			"reasoning": "This task is moderately complex, involving real-time status tracking and potential future extensibility. Polling logic and DB updates are standard, but must be robust and performant."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Timeline, Chart, and Table Visualization Components",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break into: (1) TimelineSection component, (2) ChartSection with multiple chart types, (3) TableSection with sorting/filtering, (4) dynamic schema/displayType handling, (5) interactivity and error handling, (6) component/unit/visual tests.",
			"reasoning": "Multiple visualization types, dynamic data handling, and interactivity requirements increase complexity. Each component must be modular, reusable, and thoroughly tested for schema compatibility."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 11,
			"taskTitle": "Enhance Markdown Rendering and Conversion Logic",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: (1) MarkdownSection rendering upgrades, (2) blueprint-to-markdown conversion logic, (3) heading/table/blockquote formatting, (4) visual enhancements (zebra striping, borders), (5) unit/snapshot tests for all cases.",
			"reasoning": "Markdown rendering and conversion are well-understood but require attention to formatting details and edge cases. The complexity is moderate, with a focus on correctness and visual consistency."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 12,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Blueprint Viewer with View Toggle",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose into: (1) UI toggle implementation, (2) dynamic section routing by displayType, (3) fallback handling for unknown/missing types, (4) seamless transitions and accessibility, (5) integration/UI tests, (6) user interaction edge cases.",
			"reasoning": "Supporting multiple views and dynamic routing increases UI and state management complexity. Accessibility and seamless UX are essential, requiring careful design and testing."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 13,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate Comprehensive Logging System",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: (1) log schema design, (2) logger.ts enhancements, (3) logStore.ts persistent storage, (4) event tagging and filtering, (5) sensitive data scrubbing, (6) integration with blueprint operations, (7) unit/integration tests for all log flows.",
			"reasoning": "Comprehensive logging touches multiple layers, requires schema evolution, persistent storage, and security (scrubbing). The need for structured, filterable, and reliable logs across async flows increases complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 14,
			"taskTitle": "Enhance Logs Page with Filtering, Search, and Export",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into: (1) filter UI by blueprintId/model/status, (2) search and metrics display, (3) CSV export implementation, (4) admin-only access control, (5) UI/integration tests with large datasets.",
			"reasoning": "Enhancing a logs page with filtering, search, and export is a common UI pattern, but requires careful handling of large datasets and access control. The complexity is moderate, with emphasis on usability and performance."
