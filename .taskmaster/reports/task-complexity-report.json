			"taskId": 21,
			"taskTitle": "Create Repository Backup and Branching Strategy",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the repository backup and branching strategy into subtasks covering: (1) backup creation and verification, (2) tagging and snapshotting, (3) branch creation and permissions, (4) rollback documentation and testing, (5) team communication and access setup.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves standard DevOps practices but requires careful sequencing and documentation to ensure safety and team alignment. Each step is well-defined but must be executed precisely to avoid data loss or confusion. Complexity is moderate due to the need for verification and rollback planning."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 22,
			"taskTitle": "Remove Exposed Credentials and Clean Git History",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks for: (1) identifying all exposed credentials, (2) removing secrets from working directory, (3) cleaning Git history with BFG, (4) force pushing and repository synchronization, (5) scanning for residual secrets, (6) rotating credentials and updating servers, (7) verifying cleanup and access control.",
			"reasoning": "Credential removal and history cleaning is a high-risk, multi-step process requiring expertise in Git internals, security tooling, and credential rotation. Mistakes can lead to persistent exposure or service outages. Industry standards demand thorough scanning, history rewriting, and credential rotation, making this task highly complex."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 23,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Secrets Management System",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose into: (1) .env template creation, (2) .gitignore updates, (3) git-secrets installation and configuration, (4) CI/CD secrets integration, (5) developer onboarding and documentation, (6) validation and enforcement of secrets management.",
			"reasoning": "Implementing secrets management involves multiple layers: tooling, repository configuration, developer workflows, and CI/CD integration. Ensuring future-proofing and compliance with best practices (e.g., git-secrets, .env handling) adds complexity, especially in distributed teams."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 24,
			"taskTitle": "Conduct Comprehensive Dependency Audit",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: (1) dependency scanner implementation, (2) cross-app dependency analysis, (3) report generation, (4) manual verification of critical paths, (5) simulation of app removal, (6) build and test validation post-removal.",
			"reasoning": "Mapping dependencies across multiple applications requires both automated and manual analysis, especially to ensure safe removal of unused apps. The need for custom scripts, cross-referencing, and validation against production usage increases complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 25,
			"taskTitle": "Remove smartslate-app Directory",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: (1) archiving unused app, (2) branch management and documentation, (3) removal from main branch, (4) post-removal build and test verification.",
			"reasoning": "Once dependencies are confirmed, archiving and removing an unused directory is straightforward but requires careful branch management and post-removal validation to avoid regressions. Complexity is moderate due to the need for verification."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 26,
			"taskTitle": "Extract and Remove Nested frontend/smartslate-polaris",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose into: (1) identification of unique components, (2) migration and import path updates, (3) removal of nested app, (4) testing migrated components, (5) documentation of changes.",
			"reasoning": "Component migration and duplicate app removal require careful analysis to avoid loss of unique functionality and ensure all references are updated. Testing and documentation are essential to maintain stability, making this moderately complex."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 27,
			"taskTitle": "Organize Documentation into Hierarchical Structure",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: (1) directory structure creation, (2) categorization script development, (3) metadata header insertion, (4) file migration and link updates, (5) validation of documentation search/navigation.",
			"reasoning": "Documentation reorganization is a well-scoped task but involves scripting, metadata management, and validation of internal links and searchability. Complexity is moderate due to the volume and need for accuracy."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 28,
			"taskTitle": "Standardize Frontend Code Structure",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: (1) directory structure planning, (2) moving components, (3) updating import paths, (4) refactoring for best practices, (5) running compiler and tests, (6) documentation of new structure.",
			"reasoning": "Standardizing code structure involves significant file operations, refactoring, and validation to ensure no regressions. Adhering to best practices and updating all references increases complexity, especially in larger codebases."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 29,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Comprehensive Quality Assurance",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: (1) automated test suite execution, (2) coverage analysis, (3) manual feature verification, (4) performance and bundle analysis, (5) documentation of results, (6) issue tracking and resolution, (7) stakeholder sign-off.",
			"reasoning": "Comprehensive QA requires coordination of automated and manual testing, coverage enforcement, performance checks, and stakeholder communication. High complexity arises from the breadth of verification and the need for thorough documentation and sign-off."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 30,
			"taskTitle": "Deploy to Production with Monitoring",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose into: (1) pre-deployment checklist validation, (2) release creation and tagging, (3) deployment execution, (4) monitoring setup and health checks, (5) alerting and incident response, (6) post-mortem documentation.",
			"reasoning": "Production deployment with monitoring involves multiple coordinated steps, including validation, release management, monitoring configuration, and incident response planning. Complexity is high due to the critical nature and need for robust monitoring and rollback procedures."
