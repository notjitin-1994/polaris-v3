			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Upgrade and Configure Tailwind CSS v4",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the upgrade into: (1) Branch and backup, (2) Install Tailwind v4 and dependencies, (3) Update CSS imports and remove legacy directives, (4) Migrate configuration to CSS-first, (5) Integrate Vite plugin if applicable, (6) Test for new features, content detection, and absence of gradients.",
			"reasoning": "Major version upgrades require careful migration, dependency updates, and configuration changes. Tailwind v4 introduces a new CSS-first config, automatic content detection, and breaking changes that must be validated. Each step (install, config, migration, testing) is distinct and critical for a robust upgrade."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Remove All Gradient Treatments",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: (1) Audit all specified files for gradients, (2) Remove Tailwind gradient classes, (3) Refactor inline gradients in CSS/JSX, (4) Replace with approved solid or glass tokens, (5) Manual visual verification in light and dark modes.",
			"reasoning": "Requires a thorough audit and careful refactoring across multiple files, with manual inspection to ensure compliance and no regressions. The need to replace with approved tokens and verify in multiple themes adds complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Define and Apply Semantic Design Tokens",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose into: (1) Inventory all color, spacing, and effect usages, (2) Define CSS variables for tokens in globals.css, (3) Map tokens to Tailwind classes, (4) Refactor components to use tokens, (5) Replace hardcoded values, (6) Validate with browser dev tools, (7) Visual consistency review.",
			"reasoning": "Tokenization is foundational and impacts the entire codebase. It requires inventory, definition, mapping, refactoring, and validation steps, each with significant attention to detail and risk of regressions."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Standardize Button Component Patterns",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into: (1) Audit all button usages, (2) Implement CVA-based button component, (3) Apply semantic tokens and glass effects, (4) Remove legacy button styles, (5) Add accessibility features, (6) Test all variants and states.",
			"reasoning": "Component standardization with CVA, semantic tokens, and accessibility requires both code and design refactoring, as well as comprehensive testing for all states and variants."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Refactor Form Inputs to Consistent Patterns",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: (1) Audit all input components, (2) Define standard utility class patterns, (3) Refactor each input type, (4) Remove legacy/inline styles, (5) Ensure accessibility and contrast compliance, (6) Test in Storybook and with a11y tools.",
			"reasoning": "Standardizing all input types for utility classes, tokens, and accessibility is a broad refactor, requiring careful audit, design, and testing across multiple component types."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Implement and Apply Glass Effect Utilities",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: (1) Define glass effect utilities in globals.css, (2) Refactor card, modal, and overlay components to use utilities, (3) Ensure no excessive nesting, (4) Visual and performance validation.",
			"reasoning": "Utility creation and application is straightforward but requires careful application and validation to avoid performance or visual issues."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Standardize Layout, Grid, and Container Patterns",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose into: (1) Audit all layout, grid, and container components, (2) Update to standard class patterns, (3) Replace arbitrary spacing with tokens, (4) Test at multiple breakpoints, (5) Validate with browser dev tools.",
			"reasoning": "Standardizing layout patterns is a moderate refactor, requiring audit, update, and responsive testing, but is less complex than foundational tokenization."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Align Dark Mode Implementation",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: (1) Audit all components for dark mode support, (2) Replace manual CSS variable swaps with Tailwind dark: variants, (3) Ensure all tokens have dark equivalents, (4) Implement system preference and manual toggling, (5) Test visual consistency, (6) Run automated dark mode tests, (7) Accessibility validation.",
			"reasoning": "Dark mode alignment is complex due to the need for comprehensive audit, refactor, and testing across all components and states, with both system and manual toggling."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Extract and Replace Arbitrary Values with Tokens",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: (1) Search for arbitrary values in codebase, (2) Extract repeated values to tokens, (3) Refactor usages to tokens or Tailwind scale, (4) Document one-off values, (5) Validate with linting and visual inspection.",
			"reasoning": "Requires codebase-wide search, extraction, and refactoring, but is less risky than foundational tokenization or dark mode overhaul."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Audit and Fix Accessibility Gaps",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: (1) Audit interactive elements for focus-visible and ARIA, (2) Standardize focus ring styles, (3) Add missing ARIA labels, (4) Ensure accessible disabled states, (5) Automated a11y testing, (6) Manual keyboard and screen reader testing.",
			"reasoning": "Accessibility audits and fixes require both automated and manual review, code changes, and validation to meet standards, making this a high-complexity, multi-step task."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 11,
			"taskTitle": "Remove Unused CSS and Legacy Styles",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose into: (1) Run PurgeCSS or Tailwind purge, (2) Manually audit globals.css and components, (3) Remove legacy/unused classes, (4) Regression test for visual breakage, (5) Validate bundle size reduction.",
			"reasoning": "Codebase cleanup is moderately complex, requiring both automated and manual steps, with regression testing to ensure no breakage."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 12,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Linting and Class Order Enforcement",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: (1) Configure Prettier and ESLint with plugins, (2) Add custom lint rules for anti-patterns, (3) Integrate linting into CI, (4) Test linting and auto-fix on codebase.",
			"reasoning": "Linting setup is well-supported by tooling and patterns, but requires configuration, rule customization, CI integration, and validation."
