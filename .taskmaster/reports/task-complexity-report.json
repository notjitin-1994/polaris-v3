			"taskTitle": "Implement Question Generation Service with AI SDK",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the question generation service implementation into subtasks covering: 1) Core generateQuestions function with AI SDK integration, 2) Request deduplication and correlation ID tracking, 3) Timeout and error handling implementation, 4) Performance optimization and memory usage tracking, and 5) Retry logic with exponential backoff.",
			"reasoning": "This task has high complexity due to the integration with the AI SDK for structured output generation, implementation of triple-fallback logic, and strict performance requirements (3s max response time). The request deduplication, comprehensive error boundaries, memory usage tracking, and retry logic with exponential backoff all add significant complexity. Testing will be challenging, requiring mocked providers, real API calls, performance testing, and memory leak detection."

		{
			"taskId": 15,
			"taskTitle": "Update Question Generation API Route with Backward Compatibility",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the API route update into subtasks covering: 1) Integration of questionGenerationService with feature flag support, 2) Response format compatibility and correlation ID tracking, and 3) Error handling and request/response logging implementation.",
			"reasoning": "This task has moderate complexity as it involves updating an existing API route to use the new service while maintaining backward compatibility. The feature flag implementation adds some complexity, as does ensuring the exact same response format. Error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes and request/response logging are standard practices but require careful implementation. Testing will focus on comparing old vs new responses and verifying feature flag behavior."

			"reasoning": "This task has very high complexity due to the implementation of real-time streaming with specific requirements for chunk sizes, buffer management, and throttled updates. The streaming architecture requires careful handling of backpressure, abort signals, and timeouts. The stream validation and normalization layer adds additional complexity. Testing will be challenging, requiring mocked streams, real streaming responses, and verification of chunk size and buffer behavior."

		{
			"taskId": 17,
			"taskTitle": "Create React Hooks for Real-time Blueprint Updates",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the React hooks implementation into subtasks covering: 1) useBlueprintStream hook with EventSource integration, 2) useStreamingBlueprint hook for state management, 3) Progress tracking and partial rendering logic, and 4) Connection state management and cleanup implementation.",
			"reasoning": "This task has high complexity as it involves creating custom React hooks to handle streaming data with specific UI update requirements. The implementation requires careful state management for partial updates, progress tracking, and connection states. The integration with error boundaries and cleanup on component unmount adds complexity. Testing will be challenging, requiring mocked streams, real streaming data, and verification of UI update frequency."

			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the monitoring implementation into subtasks covering: 1) Performance metrics middleware (response time, throughput, error rates), 2) Resource usage tracking system, 3) Business metrics collection, 4) Provider health monitoring, and 5) Token consumption tracking and alert configuration.",
			"reasoning": "This task has high complexity due to the comprehensive nature of the monitoring requirements. It involves implementing various types of metrics (performance, resource usage, business metrics), provider health monitoring, and token consumption tracking. The alert configuration with different priority levels adds complexity. Testing will require integration with monitoring systems and simulation of various failure scenarios to verify alert thresholds."

			"reasoning": "This task has maximum complexity as it involves creating a comprehensive test suite with 95% coverage across multiple test types (unit, integration, performance). The requirements include testing all provider scenarios, streaming behavior, and fallback logic. Setting up MSW for API mocking, creating performance benchmarks, testing concurrency with up to 100 simultaneous requests, and implementing cross-browser/device testing all add significant complexity. The task depends on multiple other complex tasks being completed first."

			"taskId": 20,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Feature Flag Rollout System and Deployment Strategy",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the feature flag rollout system into subtasks covering: 1) Feature flag implementation with percentage-based rollout, 2) Rollout stage configuration and monitoring, 3) Automatic rollback trigger implementation, and 4) Monitoring dashboard and legacy code cleanup planning.",
			"reasoning": "This task has high complexity due to the sophisticated rollout strategy with multiple stages and automatic rollback capabilities. The percentage-based feature flag system requires careful implementation to ensure consistent user experiences. The automatic rollback triggers based on error rates and response time degradation add significant complexity. The requirement for rollback execution in under 1 minute adds time constraints. Testing will involve verifying rollout percentage logic and rollback triggers."
