			"taskTitle": "Implement Mobile-First Responsive Breakpoint System",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of a mobile-first responsive breakpoint system into subtasks covering: 1) Setting up breakpoint constants and configuration, 2) Creating responsive utility classes for containers and grids, 3) Implementing typography scale system, 4) Converting existing CSS to mobile-first architecture, 5) Setting up responsive testing framework, and 6) Documentation and migration guide",
			"reasoning": "This task involves fundamental architectural changes affecting the entire codebase. It requires careful planning of breakpoints, creating multiple utility classes, refactoring existing CSS, and establishing testing infrastructure. The complexity comes from ensuring backward compatibility while transitioning to mobile-first approach."

		{
			"taskId": 12,
			"taskTitle": "Replace Backdrop-Filter with Performance-Optimized Glass Effects",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the glass effect optimization into subtasks: 1) Create mobile-optimized glass effect classes with rgba/shadows, 2) Implement progressive enhancement with @supports queries, 3) Ensure visual consistency between mobile and desktop effects, 4) Add CSS custom properties for theming, and 5) Performance testing and optimization",
			"reasoning": "While technically focused, this task requires balancing performance with visual fidelity. The complexity lies in creating fallback styles that maintain design consistency while improving performance on mobile devices, plus implementing progressive enhancement logic."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 13,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Touch-First Component System with 44px Minimum Targets",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Structure the touch-first component system into: 1) Define touch target constants and spacing system, 2) Create touch-optimized button variants, 3) Implement accessible form controls (inputs, checkboxes, radios), 4) Add focus and active states with proper visual feedback, 5) Ensure minimum spacing between interactive elements, 6) Create touch-friendly dropdown and select components, and 7) Accessibility testing setup",
			"reasoning": "This is a comprehensive task requiring creation of multiple UI components with strict accessibility requirements. Each component needs touch optimization, proper states, and accessibility features. The 44px requirement affects layout and spacing throughout the application."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 14,
			"taskTitle": "Build Enhanced Mobile Navigation with Sheet Component",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down mobile navigation implementation into: 1) Set up Sheet component with responsive sizing, 2) Implement swipe gesture detection and handling, 3) Create navigation item components with proper touch targets, 4) Add haptic feedback integration, 5) Implement focus management and keyboard navigation, and 6) Add animation and transition effects",
			"reasoning": "This task combines UI implementation with complex gesture handling and accessibility requirements. The complexity comes from integrating multiple interaction patterns (swipe, tap, keyboard) while maintaining smooth performance and proper state management."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 15,
			"taskTitle": "Create Responsive Content Layout System",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Organize responsive layout system into: 1) Create useResponsiveContent hook with breakpoint detection, 2) Design mobile-first dashboard layouts, 3) Implement responsive chart configurations, 4) Build adaptive content cards with progressive disclosure, 5) Create responsive form layouts, 6) Implement layout switching animations, and 7) Add content priority system for mobile",
			"reasoning": "This is a complex architectural task affecting multiple content types. Each content type (dashboards, charts, cards, forms) requires different responsive strategies. The hook needs to manage state efficiently while components adapt to different layouts."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 16,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Smart Viewport Management System",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Structure viewport management into: 1) Create useViewportManager hook with device detection, 2) Implement resize and orientation change handlers with debouncing, 3) Add safe area inset handling for notched devices, 4) Create viewport-based conditional rendering utilities, and 5) Optimize viewport meta tags for mobile browsers",
			"reasoning": "While conceptually straightforward, this task requires careful handling of browser APIs, performance optimization through debouncing, and cross-device compatibility. The safe area handling adds complexity for modern devices."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 17,
			"taskTitle": "Build Progressive Enhancement Framework",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide progressive enhancement framework into: 1) Create feature detection utilities for CSS and JS capabilities, 2) Implement useProgressiveEnhancement hook, 3) Build fallback component strategies, 4) Create capability-based rendering logic, 5) Implement performance budgets system, and 6) Add feature flag management",
			"reasoning": "This task requires deep understanding of browser capabilities and creating robust fallback strategies. The complexity lies in detecting various features accurately and implementing graceful degradation without compromising core functionality."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 18,
			"taskTitle": "Optimize Images and Assets for Mobile Performance",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down image optimization into: 1) Create responsive image component with srcset support, 2) Implement lazy loading with IntersectionObserver, 3) Add format detection and WebP/AVIF fallbacks, 4) Implement blur-up placeholder technique, 5) Configure resource hints and caching strategies, and 6) Set up image optimization pipeline",
			"reasoning": "This task involves multiple optimization techniques and requires integration with build tools. The complexity comes from balancing performance gains with implementation effort and ensuring cross-browser compatibility."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 19,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Mobile-Specific Interaction Features",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Structure mobile interactions into: 1) Implement pull-to-refresh with visual feedback, 2) Add horizontal swipe gesture system, 3) Create haptic feedback API wrapper, 4) Implement long-press context menus, 5) Add momentum scrolling for lists, 6) Create touch-friendly loading states, 7) Implement offline mode detection, and 8) Add gesture tutorial system",
			"reasoning": "This is the most complex task, involving multiple advanced interaction patterns. Each feature requires careful implementation of touch events, animations, and device-specific APIs. The offline mode adds state management complexity."
