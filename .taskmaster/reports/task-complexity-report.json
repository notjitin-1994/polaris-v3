		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Extend Database Schema for Roles and Usage Tracking",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the schema extension into: (1) migration script for user_profiles columns, (2) creation of user_usage_history table, (3) creation of role_audit_log table, (4) implementation of check constraints and indexes, (5) RLS policy definition and testing, (6) documentation and test data seeding.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves significant schema changes, including new tables, columns, constraints, and RLS policies, all of which must be carefully coordinated and tested. It requires deep knowledge of PostgreSQL (including JSONB, RLS, and migrations), Supabase integration, and robust testing (including rollback and security validation). The need for documentation and test data further increases the scope. Each aspect (columns, tables, constraints, RLS, documentation, seeding) is a distinct technical challenge, justifying a high complexity score and multiple subtasks."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Define TypeScript Types and Role Mappings",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into: (1) defining core types (SubscriptionTier, UserRole, FeatureCategory), (2) implementing ROLE_LIMITS and TierLimits, (3) updating Supabase-generated types, (4) writing and validating type guard utilities and tests.",
			"reasoning": "While this task is foundational and requires careful attention to type safety and consistency, it follows standard TypeScript patterns and is well-supported by tooling. The main complexity comes from ensuring alignment with the evolving database schema and PRD, and from updating generated types. The work is modular and can be split into type definition, mapping, integration, and testing."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Backend Role Middleware and Usage Enforcement",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into: (1) requireFeature middleware, (2) checkUsageLimits middleware, (3) integration with Supabase increment_usage and atomicity, (4) structured logging and audit integration, (5) comprehensive integration and concurrency tests.",
			"reasoning": "This task is complex due to the need for robust, secure middleware that enforces business logic, integrates with the database atomically, and handles edge cases (e.g., developer bypass, race conditions). Logging and auditability add further requirements. Testing must cover both correctness and concurrency, increasing the technical challenge."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Develop React Hooks and Context for Role Awareness",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: (1) implement useUserRole hook, (2) create React Context provider, (3) optimize for performance (memoization, minimal re-renders), (4) write unit and integration tests for hooks and context.",
			"reasoning": "This task requires designing performant, reusable hooks and context providers that expose complex user state and helper logic. Ensuring minimal re-renders and correct propagation is non-trivial, especially with dynamic usage data. Testing and performance optimization are essential, but the patterns are well-established in modern React."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Build Role-Aware UI Components and Feature Gates",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: (1) FeatureGate component, (2) UsageWidget component, (3) UpgradePrompt component, (4) TierBadge component, (5) integration and visual regression tests for each tier and feature state.",
			"reasoning": "Building reusable, role-aware UI components involves conditional rendering, state management, and integration with hooks/context. Ensuring accessibility, consistent styling, and correct feature gating across the UI adds complexity. Visual regression and interaction testing are important, but the implementation follows standard React and UI library practices."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Upgrade, Downgrade, and Cancellation Flows",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into: (1) backend API endpoints for upgrade/downgrade, (2) UI for billing and tier management, (3) handling immediate limit updates and grace periods, (4) email confirmation integration, (5) read-only access logic for downgrades/cancellations, (6) end-to-end flow and edge case testing.",
			"reasoning": "This task spans backend, frontend, and email integration, with complex business logic (grace periods, read-only access, manual admin assignment). Ensuring data consistency, correct enforcement, and robust user experience across transitions is challenging. Testing must cover all transitions and edge cases."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Create Developer Role Assignment and Admin Dashboard",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: (1) secure /api/admin/assign-role endpoint, (2) admin dashboard UI for user search and role assignment, (3) audit log integration and display, (4) middleware for developer-only access, (5) integration and E2E tests for admin flows.",
			"reasoning": "This task requires secure backend endpoints, a feature-rich admin UI, audit logging, and strict access control. The dashboard must be robust and user-friendly, and all actions must be logged and tested for security. The combination of security, UI, and auditability increases complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Automate Monthly Usage Reset and Alerting",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: (1) cron job/scheduler setup, (2) reset_monthly_usage database function, (3) alerting logic for in-app and email notifications, (4) idempotency and error handling tests.",
			"reasoning": "Automating scheduled jobs and alerting involves coordination between backend, database, and notification systems. Ensuring idempotency, reliability, and timely alerts is important, but the patterns are well-understood. The main challenges are integration and robust error handling."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Comprehensive Testing Strategy",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into: (1) unit tests for types and utilities, (2) integration tests for API/database, (3) E2E tests for user/admin flows, (4) security tests (RLS, auth, rate limiting), (5) performance/load testing, (6) CI/CD pipeline setup, (7) coverage and artifact reporting.",
			"reasoning": "This task is highly complex due to the breadth of testing required (unit, integration, E2E, security, performance), the need for CI/CD integration, and the requirement to maintain high coverage and reliability. Coordinating tests across multiple layers and ensuring they are maintainable and effective is a significant challenge."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Deploy to Production with Monitoring and Runbooks",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: (1) production database migration planning, (2) staging and phased rollout, (3) monitoring and alerting setup, (4) runbook and operational documentation, (5) support team training, (6) feature flag/gradual rollout implementation.",
			"reasoning": "Production deployment is inherently high-risk and requires careful planning, monitoring, and rollback strategies. Setting up analytics, error tracking, and operational documentation, as well as training support staff, adds to the scope. The need for phased rollout and feature flagging further increases complexity."
