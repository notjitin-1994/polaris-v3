All interactive elements already have proper disabled state implementations.\n\nAUDIT RESULTS:\n\nEXISTING PROPER IMPLEMENTATIONS:\n\n1. Button Component (ui/button.tsx):\n   - Has disabled:pointer-events-none disabled:opacity-50 in base styles\n   - Properly prevents interaction when disabled\n   - Consistent across all button variants\n\n2. Form Inputs:\n   - BaseInput.tsx: disabled:opacity-50 cursor-not-allowed\n   - TextareaInput.tsx: disabled:opacity-50 cursor-not-allowed\n   - SelectInput.tsx: disabled:opacity-50 cursor-not-allowed\n   - MultiselectInput.tsx: disabled:opacity-50 cursor-not-allowed\n\n3. Auth Forms:\n   - LoginForm.tsx: All inputs have disabled:opacity-50\n   - SignupForm.tsx: All inputs have disabled:opacity-50\n\n4. Export Components:\n   - ExportButton.tsx: Buttons have disabled:opacity-50 disabled:cursor-not-allowed\n   - ExportPreviewModal.tsx: disabled:opacity-50 disabled:pointer-events-none\n\n5. Dashboard Components:\n   - DashboardFilters.tsx: Inputs have disabled:opacity-50\n   - ExportButton.tsx: disabled:opacity-50 disabled:cursor-not-allowed\n\n6. Wizard Components:\n   - StepWizard.tsx: Previous button has disabled:opacity-50 disabled:cursor-not-allowed\n\nKEY FINDINGS:\n- All buttons use HTML disabled attribute correctly\n- Form inputs properly handle disabled state\n- Visual styling is consistent (opacity-50)\n- Cursor changes to not-allowed when disabled\n- Pointer-events-none prevents interaction on disabled elements\n- Native HTML disabled attribute prevents keyboard focus\n\nNO FIXES REQUIRED:\n- All interactive elements already have proper disabled state implementation\n- Visual indicators are clear and consistent\n- Keyboard navigation automatically skips disabled elements (HTML disabled attribute)\n- No need for aria-disabled as HTML disabled attribute is sufficient for native elements\n- Contrast ratios are acceptable for disabled states (not required to meet WCAG contrast)\n\nThe disabled states are already properly implemented across the application.\n</info added on 2025-09-27T13:36:24.193Z>",
