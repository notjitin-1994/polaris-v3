The dynamic wizard utilizes the DynamicFormRenderer component for question display.\n\nKey integration requirements include replacing the old API endpoint with `/api/dynamic-questions` in `/app/loading/[id]/page.tsx`, implementing source badge display to indicate whether questions were generated by Perplexity or Ollama, enhancing error handling with proper logging mechanisms, and adding progress indicators for different generation phases.\n\nThe existing component structure includes DynamicQuestionsLoader for loading states and DynamicFormRenderer for question rendering.
