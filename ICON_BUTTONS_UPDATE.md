# Icon Buttons Update

## Overview
Converted the "Resume" and "View Blueprint" buttons from text+icon buttons to icon-only buttons for a cleaner, more modern dashboard interface.

## Changes Made

### 1. Resume Button (Draft Blueprints)
**Before:**
- Full button with "Resume" text and arrow icon
- `className="btn-primary pressable inline-flex items-center gap-2 px-4 py-2 text-sm"`

**After:**
- Icon-only button with Play icon
- `className="btn-primary pressable inline-flex h-9 w-9 items-center justify-center rounded-lg"`
- Uses `Play` icon from lucide-react (universally understood for resume/continue)

### 2. View Blueprint Button (Completed Blueprints)
**Before:**
- Full button with "View Blueprint" text and arrow icon
- `className="btn-primary pressable inline-flex items-center gap-2 bg-[#10b981] px-4 py-2 text-sm hover:bg-[#059669]"`

**After:**
- Icon-only button with Eye icon
- `className="btn-primary pressable inline-flex h-9 w-9 items-center justify-center rounded-lg bg-[#10b981] hover:bg-[#059669]"`
- Uses `Eye` icon from lucide-react (universally understood for viewing content)

## Icon Choices

### Play Icon (Resume)
- **Rationale**: The Play icon is universally recognized across all platforms and media players as the symbol for "start" or "resume"
- **User Recognition**: Instantly recognizable, no learning curve required
- **Context**: Perfectly matches the action of resuming/continuing a blueprint workflow

### Eye Icon (View)
- **Rationale**: The Eye icon is the standard symbol for viewing/previewing content across all modern interfaces
- **User Recognition**: Universally understood, used in countless applications and websites
- **Context**: Clearly indicates the user will be viewing/reading the completed blueprint

## Design Consistency

Both buttons now:
- Have consistent square dimensions (`h-9 w-9`)
- Use the same visual style as the existing Rename button (Pencil icon)
- Maintain proper accessibility with `title` and `aria-label` attributes
- Include `aria-hidden="true"` on icons for screen readers
- Follow the existing pressable and interactive styling patterns

## Accessibility

✅ **Maintained full accessibility:**
- Each button has descriptive `title` attribute for tooltips
- Each button has descriptive `aria-label` for screen readers
- Icons are marked with `aria-hidden="true"` to avoid redundant announcements
- Buttons maintain proper focus states and keyboard navigation

## Visual Improvements

1. **Cleaner Interface**: Reduces visual clutter with more compact buttons
2. **Consistent Styling**: All action buttons (Rename, Resume, View, Complete Questions) now follow the same icon-based pattern
3. **Modern Design**: Icon-only buttons are a contemporary design pattern that aligns with modern UI/UX standards
4. **Space Efficiency**: Allows more room for blueprint information in the card layout

## Browser Compatibility

- Uses Lucide React icons (already in use throughout the project)
- CSS classes follow existing Tailwind patterns
- No new dependencies added
- Compatible with all modern browsers

## Testing Recommendations

1. ✅ Verify tooltips appear on hover
2. ✅ Test keyboard navigation and focus states
3. ✅ Verify screen reader announcements
4. ✅ Test on mobile devices for touch target size
5. ✅ Verify color contrast meets WCAG standards
