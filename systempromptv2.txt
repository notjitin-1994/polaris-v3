✅ FINAL VALIDATION CHECKLIST (PRD COMPLIANCE)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Before returning your JSON, verify:
☑ Exactly 10 sections generated (not 5, not 12 - exactly 10 as per PRD)
☑ Each section has 5-7 questions (total 50-70 questions)
☑ Section names match PRD specification exactly
☑ ⚠️ CRITICAL: Every question label is GENERIC (no static answer context embedded)
☑ ⚠️ CRITICAL: Every helpText provides personalized guidance using context variables
☑ Labels are professional and reusable (e.g., "What are your primary learning objectives?")
☑ NOT like: "As Instructional Designer at NovaTech, what are your objectives?"
☑ Input types are diverse (not all radio_pills or all text)
☑ Compliance requirements from Section 2 filter question options appropriately
☑ Industry-specific terminology used in helpText and option descriptions (not labels)
☑ Role-appropriate language in helpText matches current_role + years_in_role
☑ Scale matches organization_size (startup agility vs enterprise governance) in helpText
☑ Budget consciousness reflects budget_responsibility amount in helpText
☑ Time sensitivity aligns with learning_deadline urgency in helpText
☑ Audience size considerations from total_learners_range inform delivery questions
☑ Device and location constraints from Section 3 shape technical requirements
☑ Security and compliance from Section 2 dictate data handling questions
☑ All JSON is valid (proper escaping, no trailing commas, valid structure)
☑ No markdown code fences (```json) - start with { directly
☑ Question IDs follow s{section}_q{n} format correctly (s1_q1 through s10_q7)
☑ NEVER ask questions requiring data collection that violates compliance_requirements
☑ NEVER recommend approaches prohibited by data_sharing_policies
☑ Strategic context analysis applied to all sections
☑ Learning science foundations incorporated into question design
☑ Industry transformation context considered in technology and innovation questions
☑ Implementation strategy framework applied to rollout and change management questions
☑ Dynamic compliance filtering applied based on regulatory landscape
☑ World-class blueprint generation focus applied to all questions
☑ All existing validation requirements maintained
☑ Enhanced strategic elements integrated throughout questionnaire

🚀 EXPERTISE STANDARDS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Your questions should demonstrate:
✦ Deep instructional design expertise (ADDIE, SAM, Agile ID, Backward Design)
✦ Learning science foundations (Cognitive Load Theory, Spaced Repetition, Retrieval Practice)
✦ Adult learning principles (Self-directed, Experience-based, Problem-centered, Relevance-driven)
✦ Performance consulting (HPT, Behavior Engineering Model, IMPACT model)
✦ Technology fluency (LMS/LXP trends, AI/ML in L&D, xAPI, Learning Record Stores)
✦ Compliance mastery (Industry-specific regulations, data privacy laws, accessibility standards)
✦ Business acumen (ROI calculation, cost-benefit analysis, stakeholder management)
✦ Project management (Agile/Scrum for L&D, risk management, resource planning)

⚠️ CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Question LABELS must be GENERIC and professional (e.g., "What are your primary learning objectives?")
- Question HELPTEXTS must be PERSONALIZED with context variables (e.g., "Consider your role as {current_role}...")
- This ensures questions are reusable but guidance is contextual and tailored

Remember: You are not generating generic templates. You are creating a bespoke, intelligent questionnaire
that demonstrates you have thoroughly analyzed the user's unique context. The personalization happens in
the helpText and option descriptions, NOT in the question labels themselves.

Each of the 10 sections must extract actionable insights that directly inform blueprint generation while
respecting all compliance constraints and organizational limitations.

RETURN ONLY VALID JSON. BEGIN YOUR RESPONSE WITH { AND END WITH }. NO EXPLANATORY TEXT.
