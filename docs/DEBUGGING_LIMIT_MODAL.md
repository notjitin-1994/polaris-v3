# Debugging: Why Modal Doesn't Show

## What Your Console Logs Reveal

Looking at your console output, here's what's happening:

### 1. You're NOT Actually At Your Limit

```
üîç QuickActionsCardWithLimits state: {
  isAtCreationLimit: false,
  loading: false,
  generationsRemaining: 5,       ‚Üê You have 5 remaining!
  maxGenerationsMonthly: 5        ‚Üê Your limit is 5 total
}

üñ±Ô∏è Button clicked: Create New Starmap {
  requiresLimitCheck: true,
  isAtCreationLimit: false        ‚Üê NOT at limit!
}

‚úÖ Not at limit, navigating to: /static-wizard
```

**Interpretation**: You have **5 blueprints remaining out of 5**, which means you've used **0 out of 5**. You're not at your limit!

### 2. The Redirect Loop Issue

The logs show:
```
page.tsx:387 User at creation limit, redirecting to dashboard (appears twice)
```

This happened because:
1. Dashboard loads ‚Üí hook initially returns `isAtCreationLimit: true` (during loading, before data arrives)
2. You click button ‚Üí navigates to `/static-wizard`
3. Static-wizard loads ‚Üí hook initially returns `isAtCreationLimit: true` again (during loading)
4. Static-wizard's redirect triggers before data loads
5. Redirects back to dashboard
6. Loop repeats

## Fixes Applied

### Fix 1: Wait for Loading to Complete

**File**: `QuickActionsCardWithLimits.tsx`

```typescript
// Don't check limit while still loading
if (loading) {
  console.log('‚è≥ Still loading limits, please wait...');
  return;
}
```

Now the button won't do anything if clicked while the hook is still loading data.

### Fix 2: Static-Wizard Redirect Waits for Loading

**File**: `static-wizard/page.tsx`

```typescript
// Don't check while still loading limit data
if (limitsLoading) {
  return;
}
```

The redirect won't trigger until limit data has fully loaded.

## Why You're Not Seeing the Modal

**Simple answer**: Because you're not at your limit!

Your database shows:
- `generationsRemaining: 5`
- `maxGenerationsMonthly: 5`
- Used: 0 / 5

Since you have blueprints remaining, the system correctly **lets you navigate** to the static questionnaire instead of showing an upgrade modal.

## How to Actually Test the Modal

### Option 1: Run SQL Script to Set Yourself At Limit

I've created a script for you: `scripts/set_user_at_limit.sql`

**Steps**:
1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí SQL Editor
2. Run the script `check_user_limits.sql` first to see your current values
3. Run the script `set_user_at_limit.sql` to set yourself at the limit
4. Go back to your app and click "Create New Starmap"
5. **You should now see the modal!**

### Option 2: Create 5 Blueprints to Reach Limit Naturally

1. Click "Create New Starmap" 5 times
2. Complete the static questionnaire 5 times
3. On the 6th attempt, you'll see the modal

## What the Modal Should Look Like When At Limit

Once you're actually at your limit, here's what should happen:

### 1. Console Output
```
üîç QuickActionsCardWithLimits state: {
  isAtCreationLimit: true,        ‚Üê At limit!
  loading: false,
  generationsRemaining: 0,        ‚Üê No remaining!
  maxGenerationsMonthly: 5
}

üñ±Ô∏è Button clicked: Create New Starmap {
  requiresLimitCheck: true,
  isAtCreationLimit: true         ‚Üê At limit!
}

üö´ At creation limit! Showing upgrade modal
Limit details: {
  generationsRemaining: 0,
  maxGenerationsMonthly: 5,
  currentGenerations: 5
}
```

### 2. Visual Behavior
- ‚úÖ Button appears grayed out (opacity-50)
- ‚úÖ Cursor shows "not-allowed"
- ‚úÖ Button text: "Limit reached - Upgrade required"
- ‚úÖ Click shows **UpgradePromptModal** (not navigation!)
- ‚úÖ Modal has "Upgrade Now" and "Cancel" buttons
- ‚úÖ User stays on dashboard after closing modal

## Verification Scripts

### Check Your Current Limits
```bash
# File: scripts/check_user_limits.sql
```

Run this in Supabase SQL Editor to see:
- Your subscription tier
- Current usage counts
- Remaining blueprints
- Whether you can create

### Set Yourself At Limit (For Testing)
```bash
# File: scripts/set_user_at_limit.sql
```

This will:
- Set `blueprint_creation_count = blueprint_creation_limit`
- Make you "at limit" for testing
- Show you the verification queries

### Reset Your Usage (To Start Fresh)
```sql
-- Uncomment and run this in Supabase SQL Editor:
UPDATE user_profiles
SET
  blueprint_creation_count = 0,
  current_month_creation_count = 0,
  blueprint_saving_count = 0,
  updated_at = now()
WHERE user_id = auth.uid();
```

## Debugging Steps for You

### Step 1: Check Actual Database Values

1. Open Supabase Dashboard
2. Go to SQL Editor
3. Run `scripts/check_user_limits.sql`
4. Check the output:
   - What is your `blueprint_creation_count`?
   - What is your `blueprint_creation_limit`?
   - What does `check_blueprint_creation_limits()` return?

### Step 2: Set Yourself At Limit

1. Run `scripts/set_user_at_limit.sql`
2. Verify the output shows you're at limit

### Step 3: Test the Modal

1. Go to your app dashboard
2. Open browser console (F12)
3. Click "Create New Starmap"
4. **Check console logs**:
   - Does it say `isAtCreationLimit: true`?
   - Does it log "üö´ At creation limit! Showing upgrade modal"?
5. **Check the screen**:
   - Does the modal appear?

### Step 4: Share Results

If the modal still doesn't show after setting yourself at limit, share:
1. Console output from clicking the button
2. Output from `check_user_limits.sql`
3. Output from `set_user_at_limit.sql`
4. Screenshot of what you see

## Common Issues

### Issue 1: "Page Keeps Reloading"
**Cause**: Loading state causing redirect loop
**Fix**: Applied - now waits for `loading: false`

### Issue 2: "Button Does Nothing"
**Cause**: Clicking while still loading
**Fix**: Applied - shows "‚è≥ Still loading limits, please wait..." in console

### Issue 3: "Modal Doesn't Show But I'm At Limit"
**Cause**: Hook returning wrong values
**Solution**: Check database with `check_user_limits.sql`

### Issue 4: "Says I Have Blueprints Remaining But I Don't"
**Possible causes**:
1. You upgraded to a higher tier (explorer gives 5/month vs free 2/lifetime)
2. Database counts not incremented properly
3. Monthly reset occurred (paid tiers reset monthly)

**Solution**: Check `current_month_creation_count` vs `blueprint_creation_count` in database

## Understanding Your Tier

Based on your logs showing `maxGenerationsMonthly: 5`:

You're likely on the **Explorer tier**:
- **Limit**: 5 blueprints per month
- **Resets**: Monthly (not lifetime like free tier)
- **Current usage**: 0 / 5

If you want to test with the free tier (2 lifetime limit):
```sql
UPDATE user_profiles
SET
  subscription_tier = 'free',
  blueprint_creation_limit = 2,
  blueprint_saving_limit = 2,
  blueprint_creation_count = 0,
  current_month_creation_count = 0
WHERE user_id = auth.uid();
```

## Summary

**Why modal doesn't show**: You're not at your limit! You have 5 blueprints remaining.

**To see the modal**: Run `scripts/set_user_at_limit.sql` to artificially set yourself at the limit.

**System is working correctly**: When you're truly at your limit, the modal will show. Right now, you're not at the limit, so the system correctly lets you create blueprints.

**Fixes applied**:
- ‚úÖ Fixed redirect loop by waiting for loading to complete
- ‚úÖ Button now waits for data before checking limit
- ‚úÖ Added comprehensive debugging logs
- ‚úÖ Created SQL scripts for testing

**Next steps**:
1. Run `scripts/check_user_limits.sql` to see your actual limits
2. Run `scripts/set_user_at_limit.sql` to test the modal
3. Click "Create New Starmap" and the modal should appear!
