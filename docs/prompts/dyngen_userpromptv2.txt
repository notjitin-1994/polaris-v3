🔍 COMPLIANCE CONTEXT ANALYSIS:
COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS: {compliance_requirements}
DATA POLICY: {data_sharing_policies}
SECURITY LEVEL: {security_clearance}
INDUSTRY SECTOR: {industry_sector}
ORGANIZATION SIZE: {organization_size}
GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS: {geographic_regions}

🎯 DYNAMIC FILTERING STRATEGY:
Generate compliance-aware questions by dynamically adapting options and constraints based on the specific regulatory landscape, data handling requirements, and security posture of this organization.

📋 CONTEXT-AWARE FILTERING RULES:

1. REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FILTERING:
   - Analyze {compliance_requirements} array to identify specific regulatory frameworks
   - For each identified framework, dynamically include relevant compliance questions
   - Adapt question options to reflect regulatory burden and complexity
   - Example: If "HIPAA" detected, automatically include PHI handling, BAA requirements, and audit trail questions

2. DATA SOVEREIGNTY & RESIDENCY FILTERING:
   - Based on {data_sharing_policies}, dynamically adjust technology and vendor options
   - For {geographic_regions}, include data residency and localization requirements
   - Example: If "Highly Restricted" + "EU regions", automatically exclude cloud-only options and include on-premise alternatives

3. SECURITY POSTURE FILTERING:
   - Based on {security_clearance}, dynamically adjust access control and collaboration options
   - Include compartmentalization questions for high security environments
   - Example: If "Top Secret" detected, automatically include need-to-know access options and filter out non-secure tools

4. INDUSTRY-SPECIFIC COMPLIANCE FILTERING:
   - Based on {industry_sector}, dynamically include industry-specific regulatory questions
   - Adapt options to reflect industry-standard compliance practices
   - Example: If "Financial Services" + "SOX", automatically include audit trail and immutable record requirements

5. ORGANIZATIONAL SCALE FILTERING:
   - Based on {organization_size}, dynamically adjust compliance complexity and governance questions
   - Include enterprise governance questions for large organizations
   - Example: If "10000+" employees, include multi-jurisdictional compliance and governance frameworks

🔧 DYNAMIC FILTER IMPLEMENTATION:

FOR EACH COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENT IDENTIFIED:

IF "{requirement_name}" IN {compliance_requirements}:
   - DYNAMICALLY generate questions specific to {requirement_name} compliance
   - Include options that reflect {requirement_name} implementation best practices
   - Add helpText explaining {requirement_name} implications for {industry_sector}

🌍 MULTI-REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT HANDLING:

FOR ORGANIZATIONS WITH MULTIPLE COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS:
   - Generate questions addressing regulatory overlap and conflicts
   - Include prioritization frameworks for competing requirements
   - Add helpText explaining trade-offs and decision criteria
   - Consider {budget_responsibility} level when evaluating compliance investment capacity

FOR CROSS-BORDER ({geographic_regions}) COMPLIANCE:
   - Generate questions about multi-jurisdictional compliance complexity
   - Include data residency, transfer, and localization requirements
   - Add options reflecting global vs. regional implementation strategies
   - Consider {legal_restrictions} when evaluating international compliance constraints

🎯 COMPLIANCE-AWARE QUESTION GENERATION:

EVERY QUESTION MUST:
1. DYNAMICALLY assess compliance requirements based on identified frameworks
2. Include context-specific compliance implications in helpText
3. Adapt options to reflect compliance burden and implementation complexity
4. Reference {organization_size} and {budget_responsibility} in compliance approach recommendations
