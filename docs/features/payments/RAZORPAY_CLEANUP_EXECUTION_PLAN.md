## Executive Summary

SmartSlate Polaris v3 has recently migrated from USD-based pricing to INR-based pricing for Razorpay subscription plans. This has resulted in old, outdated plans that need to be cleaned up to maintain dashboard hygiene and prevent confusion.

**Current Situation:**
- ‚úÖ **New INR Plans Created**: 12 plans (6 tiers √ó 2 billing cycles) on 2025-10-29
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Old USD Plans**: Likely exist and need cleanup
- üîß **Tools Ready**: Automated scripts and documentation created

**Estimated Time to Complete**: 15-30 minutes
**Risk Level**: Low (with proper precautions)

## Execution Checklist

### Pre-Execution Checklist ‚úÖ

- [x] **Environment Variables**: Razorpay credentials configured in `.env.local`
- [x] **Current Plans Identified**: All 12 active plans documented
- [x] **Scripts Created**: `list-razorpay-plans.ts` and `delete-old-razorpay-plans.ts`
- [x] **Documentation Created**: Comprehensive cleanup guide
- [x] **Package.json Updated**: New npm scripts added
- [x] **Safety Mechanisms**: Built-in checks for active subscriptions

### Execution Steps

#### Step 1: Inventory Current Plans (5 minutes)

```bash
cd frontend
npm run list-razorpay-plans
```

**Expected Outcome:**
- List of all plans in your Razorpay account
- Classification into Current vs Old plans
- Identification of plans with active subscriptions
- Safety recommendations

#### Step 2: Review Cleanup Candidates (2 minutes)

Review the output from Step 1 and identify:
- ‚úÖ Plans safe to delete (0 active subscriptions)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Plans that need manual migration (active subscriptions)
- ‚ùì Plans requiring investigation

#### Step 3: Dry Run Deletion (2 minutes)

```bash
npm run delete-old-razorpay-plans --dry-run
```

**Expected Outcome:**
- Preview of exactly which plans will be deleted
- Final safety checks and warnings
- Confirmation that no current plans will be affected

#### Step 4: Execute Deletion (5-10 minutes)

```bash
npm run delete-old-razorpay-plans --confirm
```

**Expected Outcome:**
- Confirmation prompt before actual deletion
- Only deletes plans with 0 active subscriptions
- Detailed logging of actions taken
- Final summary of cleanup results

#### Step 5: Verification (3-5 minutes)

```bash
npm run list-razorpay-plans
```

**Expected Outcome:**
- Confirmation that only current plans remain
- Dashboard is clean and organized
- No unexpected errors or issues

## Safety Mechanisms

### Built-in Protections

1. **Current Plan Protection**: Scripts automatically skip all current plan IDs
2. **Active Subscription Check**: Will not delete plans with active subscribers
3. **Dry Run Mode**: Preview changes before executing
4. **Confirmation Prompts**: Requires explicit user confirmation
5. **Detailed Logging**: Every action is logged for audit purposes

### Manual Verification Required

- Review the list of plans to be deleted before confirming
- Ensure no active subscriptions are on old plans
- Verify current plans are working correctly in the application

---

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk Scenarios ‚úÖ

- Deleting plans with 0 active subscriptions
- Following the step-by-step process exactly
- Running dry-run before actual deletion
- Having current plan backups documented

### Medium Risk Scenarios ‚ö†Ô∏è

- Plans with active subscriptions (will be automatically skipped)
- Network interruptions during script execution
- API rate limiting (script handles gracefully)

### High Risk Scenarios ‚ùå

- Manually deleting plans without checking subscriptions
- Modifying scripts without understanding the logic
- Running scripts in production without testing in test mode first

---

## Recovery Procedures

### If Something Goes Wrong

1. **Script Errors**: Scripts are non-destructive, can be re-run safely
2. **Accidental Deletion**: Razorpay has 30-day grace period for plan restoration
3. **API Issues**: Contact Razorpay support with plan IDs and timestamps
4. **Application Issues**: Revert to previous deployment and verify plan configurations
