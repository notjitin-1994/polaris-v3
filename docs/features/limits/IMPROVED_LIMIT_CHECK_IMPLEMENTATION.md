# Improved Limit Check Implementation

## Problem

User was being navigated to the static questionnaire page even when at their limit. The error only appeared when trying to save, not when clicking the button on the landing page.

## Root Cause

The component was using cached limit data (`isAtCreationLimit`) which could be stale:
- User might have just reached their limit
- Data might not have refreshed since page load
- Race conditions between client and server state

## Solution

Instead of relying on cached data, the component now performs a **fresh server-side check** every time the "Create New Starmap" button is clicked.

### Implementation Details

**File**: `frontend/components/dashboard/QuickActionsCardWithLimits.tsx`

#### Key Changes:

1. **Server-Side Check on Click**
```typescript
const handleActionClick = async (action) => {
  if (action.requiresLimitCheck) {
    setIsChecking(true);
    const result = await checkBeforeCreate(); // Fresh API call
    setIsChecking(false);

    if (!result.allowed) {
      setShowUpgradePrompt(true); // Show modal
      return;
    }
  }

  router.push(action.href); // Only navigate if allowed
};
```

2. **Uses `checkBeforeCreate()` from Hook**
   - This function makes a fresh API call to `/api/user/usage`
   - Checks actual database values
   - Returns `{ allowed: boolean, reason?: string }`

3. **Loading State During Check**
   - Shows "Checking limits..." text while verifying
   - Disables button to prevent multiple clicks
   - Visual feedback for user

4. **Comprehensive Debug Logging**
   - Logs component state on render
   - Logs button click events
   - Logs server-side check results
   - Helps diagnose any issues

## User Flow

### Scenario 1: User NOT at Limit
1. Click "Create New Starmap"
2. Button shows "Checking limits..." (< 1 second)
3. Server confirms: allowed to create
4. **Navigates to `/static-wizard`**

### Scenario 2: User AT Limit
1. Click "Create New Starmap"
2. Button shows "Checking limits..." (< 1 second)
3. Server confirms: limit reached
4. **Modal appears on landing page**
5. Options:
   - "Upgrade Now" → `/pricing`
   - "Cancel" → stay on landing page
6. **User never navigates to static questionnaire**

## Debug Console Output

When you click the button, you'll see:

```
🔍 QuickActionsCardWithLimits state: {
  isAtCreationLimit: true/false,
  loading: false,
  generationsRemaining: 0,
  maxGenerationsMonthly: 5
}

🖱️ Button clicked: Create New Starmap {
  requiresLimitCheck: true,
  loading: false,
  isAtCreationLimit: true
}

🔍 Server-side limit check result: {
  allowed: false,
  reason: "Blueprint creation limit reached. You have used 5 of 5 generations."
}

🚫 At creation limit! Showing upgrade modal
```

## Advantages of This Approach

### ✅ Always Accurate
- Fresh check every time = no stale data
- Server is source of truth
- Eliminates race conditions

### ✅ Better UX
- User never lands on static questionnaire if at limit
- Clear visual feedback ("Checking limits...")
- Modal appears exactly where it should

### ✅ Reliable
- Even if cached data is wrong, server-side check catches it
- Handles edge cases (just reached limit, etc.)
- Defense-in-depth security

### ✅ Debuggable
- Comprehensive console logging
- Easy to see what's happening
- Can diagnose user issues quickly

## Testing

### To Test Modal Appearance:

1. **Set yourself at limit** (run in Supabase SQL Editor):
```sql
UPDATE user_profiles
SET
  blueprint_creation_count = blueprint_creation_limit,
  current_month_creation_count = blueprint_creation_limit,
  updated_at = now()
WHERE user_id = auth.uid();
```

2. **Go to landing page** and open browser console (F12)

3. **Click "Create New Starmap"**

4. **Expected Console Output**:
```
🔍 QuickActionsCardWithLimits state: { isAtCreationLimit: true, ... }
🖱️ Button clicked: Create New Starmap { requiresLimitCheck: true, ... }
🔍 Server-side limit check result: { allowed: false, ... }
🚫 At creation limit! Showing upgrade modal
```

5. **Expected UI**:
   - Modal appears on landing page
   - Shows current usage (5 of 5 used)
   - "Upgrade Now" and "Cancel" buttons
   - User stays on landing page

### To Reset Limits:

```sql
UPDATE user_profiles
SET
  blueprint_creation_count = 0,
  current_month_creation_count = 0,
  updated_at = now()
WHERE user_id = auth.uid();
```

## API Endpoint Used

**Endpoint**: `GET /api/user/usage`

**Returns**:
```typescript
{
  canCreate: boolean;
  canSave: boolean;
  generationsRemaining: number;
  savedRemaining: number;
  maxGenerationsMonthly: number;
  maxSavedStarmaps: number;
  currentGenerations: number;
  currentSavedStarmaps: number;
  isExempt: boolean;
}
```

This data is used by `checkBeforeCreate()` to determine if the user can create a new blueprint.

## Comparison: Before vs After

### ❌ Before (Cached Check)
- Used `isAtCreationLimit` from hook
- Could be stale if user just reached limit
- Client state out of sync with server
- User navigated to static questionnaire, then got error

### ✅ After (Fresh Check)
- Calls API on every button click
- Always accurate, server is source of truth
- Client state synced with server
- User sees modal immediately, never navigates if at limit

## Performance

**Concern**: Does the API call slow down the UX?

**Answer**: No, minimal impact:
- API call takes < 200ms typically
- Shows "Checking limits..." feedback
- Much better than navigating to page, then showing error
- Only happens on "Create New Starmap" (not other buttons)

## Edge Cases Handled

1. **User clicks button while data is loading**: Prevented by `if (loading || isChecking) return;`
2. **User clicks button multiple times**: Prevented by `isChecking` state
3. **User reaches limit between page load and click**: Caught by fresh server-side check
4. **Server error during check**: Returns `{ allowed: false }`, shows modal (safe default)
5. **User not authenticated**: Hook handles this, returns limit exceeded

## Files Modified

1. **QuickActionsCardWithLimits.tsx**
   - Added `checkBeforeCreate` from hook
   - Made `handleActionClick` async
   - Added `isChecking` state
   - Updated disabled logic
   - Added "Checking limits..." text
   - Comprehensive debug logging

2. **No changes to static-wizard page** - it remains clean and simple

## Future Improvements

If needed, could add:
- Optimistic caching with short TTL (5-10 seconds)
- Refresh limits after navigation from static questionnaire
- Show "Checking..." spinner icon instead of text
- Pre-check on component mount to show disabled state faster

For now, the fresh check on click is the most reliable approach.
