## Pricing Page FAQs - Feature-Focused

### Q: What makes Polaris different from generic AI tools like ChatGPT?
**A:** ChatGPT gives you a blank text box. Polaris interviews you through 80+ structured questions specifically designed for learning programs, then generates a comprehensive blueprint with 11 interactive infographics. It's like having a $300/hour instructional design consultant built into the AI.

### Q: What's "triple-fallback AI" and why does it matter?
**A:** We use three AI systems: Claude Sonnet 4 (fast), Claude Opus 4 (smart), and Ollama Qwen3:32b (local). If Claude's API goes down (happened 3 times in 2024), we automatically switch to the next system. You get 100% uptime—your blueprints always generate.

### Q: How does the 12-month rollover work?
**A:** If you create 3 blueprints this month but your plan includes 5, those 2 unused blueprints bank for 12 months. Next month you could create 7 (5 new + 2 banked). Perfect for project-based work.

### Q: Can I export to PowerPoint for stakeholder presentations?
**A:** Even better—use our Presentation Mode to turn your blueprint into a navigable slideshow with 11 auto-generated infographics. Export to PDF to share, or share a live link where stakeholders can navigate slides themselves.

### Q: Do team plan limits actually scale per user?
**A:** Yes! If you have 10 people on Fleet (30 blueprints/user/month), your team gets 300 total blueprints/month. Each person has their own 30 limit + 12-month rollover. Not a shared pool.

### Q: What if I hit my limit mid-month?
**A:** We'll show you a graceful upgrade prompt with no hard blocks. You can upgrade instantly or wait until next month. Banked blueprints from rollover give you a buffer.

### Q: Can I try before I buy?
**A:** Yes! Create your first blueprint free (no credit card). Experience the full questionnaire + AI generation. If you love it, subscribe. If not, you keep the blueprint.

### Q: What does "27+ input types" mean?
**A:** Instead of boring text boxes, we have sliders for priorities, currency fields for budgets, multi-selects for learning objectives, scale ratings for confidence levels, etc. The questionnaire feels like a conversation, not a form.

### Q: Is there a setup fee or contract?
**A:** Nope. Month-to-month. Cancel anytime. No setup fees. No onboarding charges. Start today, cancel tomorrow if you want.

### Q: What's your refund policy?
**A:** If you're unhappy in your first 30 days, email us and we'll refund you—no questions asked. We're that confident you'll love it.
