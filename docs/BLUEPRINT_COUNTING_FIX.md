# Blueprint Counting Fix - Complete Implementation

## Problem Statement

The frontend was displaying incorrect blueprint counts (showing 0 generations and incorrect saves remaining) even though users had generated blueprints in the database. This was caused by:

1. **Counter columns out of sync**: The `blueprint_creation_count` and `blueprint_saving_count` columns in `user_profiles` were not matching actual data
2. **Frontend reading stale data**: Components were reading directly from counter columns instead of querying actual blueprint records
3. **No source of truth**: Counter columns could drift from reality due to errors, deletions, or migration issues

## Root Cause Analysis

### Database Level
- Counter columns (`blueprint_creation_count`, `blueprint_saving_count`) in `user_profiles` table
- These columns were incremented manually but could get out of sync
- When migrations synced counters, we found:
  - User 1: Had 1 blueprint but counters showed 0
  - User 2: Had 5 blueprints but counters showed 14 creations and 25 saves!

### Application Level
- Frontend components (`UsageStatsCard`, `BlueprintUsageDisplay`) read directly from `user_profiles` table
- Landing page (`app/page.tsx`) used `useUserProfile` hook which fetches from database
- My-starmaps page components also used profile counter columns
- API endpoint `/api/user/usage` called `get_blueprint_usage_info()` which read from counter columns

## Solution Overview

The fix implements a **database-driven counting system** that queries actual records from `blueprint_generator` table as the source of truth.

### Architecture Changes

```
OLD FLOW:
user_profiles.blueprint_creation_count (counter column)
    ↓
Frontend displays (potentially incorrect)

NEW FLOW:
blueprint_generator table (actual records)
    ↓
Database functions (get_actual_blueprint_creation_count, etc.)
    ↓
get_blueprint_usage_info() → API → Frontend
    ↓
Accurate display
```

## Implementation Details

### 1. Database Functions (Migration: 20251029000000_implement_actual_blueprint_counting.sql)

**Helper Functions Created:**

```sql
-- Count all blueprint records for a user
get_actual_blueprint_creation_count(user_id)
  → SELECT COUNT(*) FROM blueprint_generator WHERE user_id = $1

-- Count completed blueprints with data
get_actual_blueprint_saving_count(user_id)
  → SELECT COUNT(*) FROM blueprint_generator
     WHERE user_id = $1 AND status = 'completed' AND blueprint_json IS NOT NULL

-- Count blueprints for current billing cycle (paid tiers)
get_actual_current_month_counts(user_id, billing_cycle_start)
  → Returns {creation_count, saving_count} for current month
```

**Updated Core Functions:**
- `get_effective_limits()` - Now uses actual counts from database
- `increment_blueprint_creation_count()` - Checks using actual counts, syncs counter columns
- `increment_blueprint_saving_count()` - Checks using actual counts, syncs counter columns

**Performance Indexes:**
```sql
-- Optimize blueprint counting queries
CREATE INDEX idx_blueprint_generator_user_status
ON blueprint_generator(user_id, status, created_at);

-- Partial index for completed blueprints
CREATE INDEX idx_blueprint_generator_completed
ON blueprint_generator(user_id, status)
WHERE status = 'completed' AND blueprint_json IS NOT NULL;
```

### 2. API Function Update (Migration: 20251029010000_fix_get_blueprint_usage_info.sql)

**Updated `get_blueprint_usage_info()`:**
- Now calls `get_actual_blueprint_creation_count()` and `get_actual_blueprint_saving_count()`
- Returns actual database counts instead of reading counter columns
- Used by `/api/user/usage` endpoint which frontend calls

### 3. Frontend Hook (New: lib/hooks/useUserUsage.ts)

**Created `useUserUsage` custom hook:**
```typescript
export function useUserUsage() {
  // Fetches from /api/user/usage endpoint
  // Returns actual counts from database
  // Includes auto-refresh capability
  // Handles loading and error states
}
```

**Features:**
- Fetches fresh data from API on mount
- Cache: `no-store` (always gets latest data)
- Provides `refreshUsage()` function for manual refresh
- Returns structured usage data with all limits and counts

### 4. Component Updates

**Updated Components:**

1. **Landing Page** (`app/page.tsx`)
   ```typescript
   // OLD: Used useUserProfile hook → read counter columns
   const { profile } = useUserProfile();
   creationCount={profile?.blueprint_creation_count || 0}

   // NEW: Uses useUserUsage hook → actual database counts
   const { usage } = useUserUsage();
   creationCount={usage?.creationCount || 0}
   ```

2. **BlueprintUsageDisplay** (`components/dashboard/BlueprintUsageDisplay.tsx`)
   ```typescript
   // OLD: Read from profile counter columns
   const { profile } = useUserProfile();
   const creationCount = profile?.blueprint_creation_count || 0;

   // NEW: Uses useUserUsage hook with refresh capability
   const { usage, refreshUsage } = useUserUsage();
   const creationCount = usage.creationCount;
   ```

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Database Migrations
```bash
# Migrations applied (in order):
# ✅ 20251029000000_implement_actual_blueprint_counting.sql
# ✅ 20251029010000_fix_get_blueprint_usage_info.sql

# Push to remote:
npm run db:push

# Result:
# ✅ Synced 2 users with mismatched counters
# ✅ All functions created successfully
# ✅ Indexes created for performance
```

### 2. Frontend Code Updates
```bash
# Files modified:
# ✅ lib/hooks/useUserUsage.ts (new file)
# ✅ app/page.tsx (use new hook)
# ✅ components/dashboard/BlueprintUsageDisplay.tsx (use new hook)
```

### 3. Backwards Compatibility
- Counter columns still exist and are synced
- Old code reading columns will work (though slightly stale)
- `increment_*` functions are idempotent (safe to call multiple times)
- No breaking changes to API responses

## Testing & Verification

### Database Level
```sql
-- Verify counts match for a user
SELECT
  up.user_id,
  up.blueprint_creation_count as stored_creation,
  get_actual_blueprint_creation_count(up.user_id) as actual_creation,
  up.blueprint_saving_count as stored_saving,
  get_actual_blueprint_saving_count(up.user_id) as actual_saving,
  (up.blueprint_creation_count = get_actual_blueprint_creation_count(up.user_id) AND
   up.blueprint_saving_count = get_actual_blueprint_saving_count(up.user_id)) as counts_match
FROM user_profiles up
WHERE up.user_id = 'your-user-id'::UUID;

-- Find users with mismatched counters
SELECT * FROM sync_blueprint_counters();

-- Test API function
SELECT * FROM get_blueprint_usage_info('your-user-id'::UUID);
```

### Frontend Level
1. **Landing Page** (`/`)
   - Check "Usage Statistics" card shows correct counts
   - Verify "X of Y" matches actual blueprints created/saved
   - Progress bars should reflect actual usage

2. **My Starmaps Page** (`/my-starmaps`)
   - Top-right usage display shows correct counts
   - "Create" and "Save" counters match reality
   - Manual refresh button works

3. **API Testing**
   ```bash
   # Test the usage endpoint directly
   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
     http://localhost:3000/api/user/usage
   ```

## Benefits of This Approach

### 1. **Accuracy**
- ✅ Counts always match actual database state
- ✅ No possibility of counter drift
- ✅ Handles blueprint deletions correctly
- ✅ Migration-proof (survives data changes)

### 2. **Consistency**
- ✅ Single source of truth (blueprint_generator table)
- ✅ Counter columns automatically synced
- ✅ Audit trail available

### 3. **Maintainability**
- ✅ Clear separation: database functions → API → frontend
- ✅ Easy to debug (can query actual counts anytime)
- ✅ Idempotent operations (safe to retry)

### 4. **Performance**
- ✅ Optimized with proper indexes
- ✅ Efficient COUNT queries
- ✅ Caching at API level (if needed in future)

### 5. **User Experience**
- ✅ Always shows accurate counts
- ✅ Manual refresh capability
- ✅ Loading states handled gracefully
- ✅ No stale data displayed

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### Daily/Weekly Checks
```sql
-- Run this to find any counter drift
SELECT
  COUNT(*) as users_with_mismatches,
  SUM(ABS(old_creation_count - new_creation_count)) as total_creation_drift,
  SUM(ABS(old_saving_count - new_saving_count)) as total_saving_drift
FROM sync_blueprint_counters();
```

### Admin Functions
```sql
-- Sync specific user's counters
SELECT * FROM sync_blueprint_counters('user-uuid'::UUID);

-- Sync all users (shows only mismatched ones)
SELECT * FROM sync_blueprint_counters();

-- Get raw counts for debugging
SELECT
  get_actual_blueprint_creation_count('user-uuid'::UUID) as total_created,
  get_actual_blueprint_saving_count('user-uuid'::UUID) as total_saved;
```

## Migration Results

When migrations were applied, they found and fixed:

```
User 6a491e12-7fa2-41dc-82c2-c1f3d72a5bb8:
  creation: 0 → 1 (had 1 blueprint but counter showed 0)
  saving: 0 → 1

User 3244b837-2432-4f3d-aba6-a80e6d11e471:
  creation: 14 → 5 (had 5 blueprints but counter showed 14!)
  saving: 25 → 5 (had 5 saved but counter showed 25!)

Total: Synced 2 users with mismatched counters
```

This proves the counter system was broken and is now fixed!

## Future Enhancements

### Short Term (Optional)
1. **Caching**: Add short-lived cache (30s) to usage API for high traffic
2. **Real-time Updates**: Use Supabase realtime subscriptions for instant updates
3. **Analytics**: Track usage patterns and trends

### Long Term (Optional)
1. **Remove Counter Columns**: Once fully confident, remove columns entirely
2. **Materialized Views**: For complex aggregations
3. **Event Sourcing**: Track all changes for audit purposes

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise:

```sql
-- 1. Rollback database functions (restore old version)
-- 2. Revert frontend changes (restore old useUserProfile usage)
-- 3. Counter columns still exist as fallback
```

However, the current implementation is **backwards compatible**, so rollback should not be needed.
