- `@/components/admin/users/UserTable`
- `@/components/admin/users/UserFilters`
- `@/components/admin/users/BulkOperations`
- `@/components/admin/users/UserDetail`
- `@/hooks/admin/useUsers`
- `@/hooks/admin/useUserFilters`
- `@/hooks/admin/useBulkOperations`
- `@/store/adminStore`

### 2. User Table Component

**File:** `frontend/components/admin/users/UserTable.tsx`

**Features:**

**Props Interface:**
```typescript
interface UserTableProps {
  users: User[];
  loading: boolean;
  selectedUsers: string[];
  onUserSelect: (userId: string) => void;
  onUserToggle: (userId: string) => void;
  onSort?: (column: string, direction: 'asc' | 'desc') => void;
  onPageChange?: (page: number, pageSize: number) => void;
}
```

### 3. User Filters Component

**File:** `frontend/components/admin/users/UserFilters.tsx`

**Filter Options:**
- Role (Admin, Manager, User, Developer, etc.)

**Features:**
- Preset filter combinations
- Save/load filter configurations
- Real-time filter application
- Filter count badges

### 4. Bulk Operations Component

**File:** `frontend/components/admin/users/BulkOperations.tsx`

**Operations:**
- Bulk delete with confirmation
- Bulk role assignment
- Bulk status changes (suspend/activate)
- Bulk export (CSV, JSON, PDF)
- Bulk import from CSV/JSON
- Bulk email notifications
- Bulk password resets

**Features:**
- Progress tracking for operations
- Error handling with detailed logs
- Rollback capabilities
- Operation history
- Preview mode before execution

### 5. User Detail Modal

**File:** `frontend/components/admin/users/UserDetail.tsx`

**Sections:**
- Profile Information (editable)
- Role and Permissions
- Subscription Details
- Usage Statistics
- Activity Log
- Security Settings
- API Keys Management
- Notification Preferences

**Features:**
- Tabbed interface for organized information
- Real-time validation
- Change history tracking
- Quick action buttons
- Related user suggestions

## Data Management

### User Store Structure

**File:** `frontend/store/adminStore.ts`

```typescript
interface AdminUserState {
  users: User[];
  loading: boolean;
  error: string | null;
  userFilters: UserFilters;
  selectedUsers: string[];
  pagination: {
    page: number;
    pageSize: number;
    total: number;
  };
  sort: {
    column: string;
    direction: 'asc' | 'desc';
  };
}

interface User {
  id: string;
  email: string;
  name: string;
  avatar?: string;
  role: UserRole;
  status: UserStatus;
  subscription: Subscription;
  lastActive: Date;
  createdAt: Date;
  usage: UserUsage;
  permissions: Permission[];
  metadata: Record<string, any>;
}
```

### API Integration

**File:** `frontend/hooks/admin/useUsers.ts`

**API Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/admin/users` - List users with filters
- `GET /api/admin/users/:id` - Get user details
- `POST /api/admin/users` - Create new user
- `PUT /api/admin/users/:id` - Update user
- `DELETE /api/admin/users/:id` - Delete user
- `POST /api/admin/users/bulk` - Bulk operations
- `GET /api/admin/users/export` - Export users
- `POST /api/admin/users/import` - Import users
