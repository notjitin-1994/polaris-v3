🎨 INPUT TYPE REQUIREMENTS (MODERN UX ONLY)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

❌ FORBIDDEN INPUT TYPES (Poor UX):
- select (use radio_pills or radio_cards instead)
- multiselect (use checkbox_pills or checkbox_cards instead)

✅ REQUIRED INPUT TYPE MIX (Use All):
- radio_pills: 20-30% of questions (2-6 options, short labels)
- checkbox_pills: 15-20% of questions (2-8 options, multiple selection)
- radio_cards: 10-15% of questions (2-4 options with descriptions)
- checkbox_cards: 10-15% of questions (2-6 options with descriptions)

- number_spinner: 2-5% of questions (countable items)
- date: 2-5% of questions (deadlines, milestones)

ENSURE: Every section has diverse input types. Never use same type for all questions in a section.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🧠 HYPER-PERSONALIZATION REQUIREMENTS (CRITICAL)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

EVERY QUESTION MUST:
1. Keep labels GENERIC and professional (do NOT embed static answer context in labels)
   Label Example: "What are your primary learning objectives for this learning initiative?"
   NOT: "As Instructional Designer at NovaTech Solutions Inc., what are your objectives?"
   
2. Personalize the helpText using context variables from static answers
   helpText should reference {current_role}, {organization_name}, {industry_sector}, etc.
   Example helpText: "Consider your role as {current_role} working with {total_learners_range} learners in {industry_sector}."

3. Use industry-specific terminology in helpText and options (not in labels)
   Healthcare: PHI, patient outcomes, clinical protocols
   Finance: Risk management, regulatory reporting, audit trails
   Tech: Sandbox environments, CI/CD, technical debt

4. Adapt language sophistication in helpText to {current_role}
   C-Suite: Strategic impact, board reporting, competitive advantage
   Manager: Implementation, team development, operational efficiency
   ID/LXD: Pedagogical approaches, learning science, engagement

5. Filter options based on {compliance_requirements}
   GDPR: Include data residency, consent management options
   HIPAA: Add PHI handling, BAA requirements options
   SOX: Include audit trail, immutable records options

6. Consider scale in option descriptions: {organization_size}
   1-50: Agile solutions, single-vendor, rapid iteration
   1000+: Enterprise governance, phased rollout, global deployment

7. Respect {data_sharing_policies} in option filtering
   Highly Restricted: Exclude cloud-only options, add air-gapped
   Unrestricted: Include full range of modern SaaS solutions

REMEMBER: You are creating a BESPOKE questionnaire for:
- {current_role} with {years_in_role} years experience
- At {organization_name} in {industry_sector}
- Managing {team_size} team with {budget_responsibility} budget
- Addressing: {learning_gap_description}
- For {total_learners_range} learners at {current_knowledge_level}/5 level
- Complying with: {compliance_requirements}
- Under {data_sharing_policies} data policy

⚠️ CRITICAL REQUIREMENT:
- Question LABELS must be GENERIC and professional
- Question HELPTEXTS must be PERSONALIZED with context variables
- This ensures questions are reusable but guidance is contextual

Every helpText should feel custom-built for THIS specific context. No generic help text.

GENERATE NOW. RETURN ONLY VALID JSON. START WITH { END WITH }.
