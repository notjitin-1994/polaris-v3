## 🎨 How to Use the Agent

### Option 1: Let Claude Code Auto-Invoke (Recommended)

Just describe what you want in natural language. Claude Code will automatically delegate to the UX/UI Designer agent when appropriate:

```bash
# These will automatically invoke the UX/UI Designer agent:
"Create a pricing card with glassmorphism and our brand colors"
"Design a responsive navigation menu for mobile"
"Make this form accessible with proper ARIA labels"
"Add a hero section with our premium dark theme"
```

### Option 2: Explicit Agent Invocation

Use the Task tool to explicitly invoke the agent:

```bash
# In your prompt to Claude:
"Use the ux-ui-designer agent to create a dashboard card component"
```

---

## 🧪 Test Your Agent Now!

Try this simple request to verify it's working:

```bash
# Type this in Claude Code:
"Create a simple button component using our SmartSlate brand colors"
```

**Expected Output:**
- Button using `bg-primary` (#a7dadb)
- Minimum 44px height for touch
- Proper hover and focus states
