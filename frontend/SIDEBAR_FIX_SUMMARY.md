# Sidebar Integration for My Starmaps Page

## Summary
The my-starmaps page at `http://localhost:3000/my-starmaps` was missing the sidebar navigation that appears on other authenticated pages.

## Problem
The my-starmaps page was located at `/app/my-starmaps/page.tsx`, outside of the `(auth)` route group. This meant it didn't inherit the authentication layout that includes the `GlobalLayout` component with sidebar.

## Solution
Moved the my-starmaps folder into the `(auth)` route group:
- **From**: `/app/my-starmaps/`
- **To**: `/app/(auth)/my-starmaps/`

## Technical Details

### Route Groups in Next.js
- Route groups (folders with parentheses like `(auth)`) allow sharing layouts without affecting the URL structure
- Pages inside `(auth)` inherit the layout at `/app/(auth)/layout.tsx`

### Auth Layout Structure
The auth layout (`/app/(auth)/layout.tsx`) wraps all pages with:
```tsx
<AuthProvider>
  <QueryProvider>
    <GlobalLayout>{children}</GlobalLayout>
  </QueryProvider>
</AuthProvider>
```

The `GlobalLayout` component includes:
- Header navigation
- Sidebar navigation (left side)
- Main content area
- Responsive layout handling

## Benefits of This Change
1. **Consistent UI**: My-starmaps now has the same layout as other authenticated pages
2. **Better Navigation**: Users can easily navigate between sections using the sidebar
3. **Authentication**: Page inherits authentication checks from the auth layout
4. **No URL Change**: The URL remains `/my-starmaps` (route groups don't affect URLs)

## Files Changed
- Moved: `/app/my-starmaps/` â†’ `/app/(auth)/my-starmaps/`
- Created test file: `/app/(auth)/my-starmaps/test-route.test.ts`

## No Code Changes Required
- All imports in the page use absolute paths (`@/...`), so no import updates needed
- Component references to `/my-starmaps` URL continue to work correctly
- No changes needed to navigation links or routing logic

## Testing
1. Build completed successfully with `npx next build`
2. TypeScript compilation passes (after clearing .next cache)
3. Route is accessible at the same URL: `http://localhost:3000/my-starmaps`
4. Sidebar now appears on the page

## Next Steps
The my-starmaps page now has full sidebar integration. Users can navigate between:
- Dashboard
- My Starmaps
- Blueprints
- Settings
- Profile
- And other authenticated sections

All while staying on the my-starmaps page.
