    2) Implement a complete cultural transformation from hierarchical to flat organization while maintaining regulatory compliance
    3) Develop advanced AI/ML capabilities in non-technical departments like HR and Finance
    4) Create multilingual, multicultural training that works across 150+ countries with vastly different educational backgrounds
    5) Address significant performance gaps in sales, customer service, technical support, R&D, and manufacturing
    6) Prepare for future technologies that don't exist yet but we know are coming
    7) Handle massive generational differences from Gen Z to traditionalists
    8) Integrate learning with work in a 24/7 global operation where downtime equals millions in losses
    
    The challenge is further complicated by union requirements, government regulations, competitor espionage concerns, and the fact that half our workforce is remote while the other half requires hands-on training with expensive equipment.`,
